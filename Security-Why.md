# Why do attackers hate us?

See [[Spam]].

## Idealogical

* FBI tries to compromise [[TOR]] because FBI hates criminals and criminals love [[TOR]].
* Anonymous claim to hack for "good of the people" - they DDoS'd the Scientology servers. (Low Orbit Ion Cannon)

## Economic

Attacker just wants to make money. Can we discourage them by raising the cost of the attack? Attacks will become unprofitable.

* China "text message cars" intercept communication between cell phones and towers. The goal is to send spam to the discovered numbers. Cost of interception device is `~$1600`, profit per day is about `~$1600`. The fine is less than `$5000`. Single car can send 200,000 msg/day. Mobile carriers make money from every text.
* Endgame Security : company that became notorious for selling zero-days. `$1.5` million would give you the IP addresses and locations of millions of vulnerable machines for a paticular zero day. `$2.5` million, "zero-day subscription package" -- 25 exploits a year.
