# Petya Green

1. Convinces users to download "pdf" files via job seeking email
1. Users often click yes for privileged access
1. Petya installs itself, overwriting the MBR master bot code to point to the Petya binary
1. Petya intentionally crashes the machine, forcing a reboot
1. Petya claims to run CHKDSK, but it's really encrypting your disk
1. Petya tells you you've been PWNd, directs you to a [[TOR]] hidden service.

It would be slow to encrypt all files. It encrypts NTFS's master file tables (inodes).
