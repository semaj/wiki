# Famous Malware

Famous pieces of [[malware|Malware]]. See [[Dynamic-Malware-Analysis]].

## Terms and Definitions
* **finger** - a utility that allows a user to discover information about another user. Server runs a daemon called `fingerd` which responds to finger requests. Responds to remote requests.
* **unix password management** - early on, Linux systems did not separate password information into `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/shadow`. There was only `/etc/passwd`, which contained the hashes and salts of every user and was readable by everyone.
* **rsh** - the predecessor to SSH. Used in conjunction with an `rhosts` file, which contained commonly connected to hosts by a given user.

## The Morris Worm (1988)
Morris claimed he was trying to "map the internet". The attack would get a root shell on a random server via a buffer overflow exploit in the `fingerd`. It would then brute force (dictionary) attack the `/etc/passwd` file. After that, it would attempt to connect to any machines the user connected to via `rsh`. It would then repeat the dictionary attack and spread.

### The Bug
The worm would check to see if the worm was already running on an infected machine, and 6/7 times, if so, it wouldn't start another copy. Unfortunately there weren't many machines on the internet, so there was a huge feedback loop, which eventually crashed machines.

## `Code_Red` (2001)
Attacked Microsoft IIS web servers. The worm sent an HTTP GET request that overflowed a buffer.

### The Bug
Once infected, the worm created 99 threads to try to infect random IP addresses. The first version had a bug, however. It used a static random seed for all worms, so every worm scanned (and eventually DoS'd) the same set of random IPs. Later versions fixed this.
